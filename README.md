# Project Objectives

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a basic front end using React for taking user input, storing it in a MongoDB database, and displaying the results.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Styling Guidelines:** Implement good styling practices using CSS or a styling framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Material-UI)

### Running React Project:

To set up and run the React project, use the following commands in your terminal:

1. Navigate to the React project directory:
    ```bash
    cd react js
    ```

2. Install project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```


### Running Node.js Project:

To set up and run the Node.js backend server with an environment file:

1. Navigate to the Node.js project directory:
    ```bash
    cd nodejs
    ```

2. Install project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create an environment file (e.g., `.env`) and add necessary configurations (e.g., MongoDB connection URL, API keys, etc.):
    ```plaintext
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_uri
    PORT=3010
    ```

4. Start the Node.js server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Running Javascript Program:

1. Navigate to the  Javascript project directory:
    ```bash
    cd javascript
    ```

2. Install project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install -g mocha
    ```
3. Start the running testcase:
     ```bash
   mocha ./tests/*
    ```
